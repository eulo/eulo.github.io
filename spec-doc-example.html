<h2>1.1 Purpose of Document</h2>
This is a Requirements Specification document for a new web-based
sales system for Solar Based Energy, Inc. (SBE).  SBE is a distributor of
alternative energy products including windmills, photovoltaics and
fuel cells. The new system will upgrade the current websites to
provide customers and employees customized browsing of the product 
catalog and the ability to complete product orders on-line.  This document
describes the scope, objectives and goal of the new system. In addition
to describing non-functional requirements, this document models the functional
requirements with use cases, interaction diagrams, and class models.  This 
document is intended to direct the design and 
implementation of the target system in an object oriented language.

<h2>1.3 Background</h2>
SBE sells state-of-the-art alternative energy systems utilizing
wind and solar power.  SBE customers include both individuals and
businesses interested in incorporating wind or solar energy sources
into either new or existing construction.  SBE has identified two
trends that they believe will cause explosive growth in the demand
for their products.  The first is the continuing energy crisis in
the western United States.  The second is the maturation of fuel
cell technology which provides a feasible system for storing excess
power generation for later use.
SBE sells state-of-the-art alternative energy systems utilizing 
wind and solar power. SBE customers include both individuals and 
businesses interested in incorporating wind or solar energy sources 
into either new or existing construction. SBE has identified several 
trends that they believe will cause explosive growth in the demand for their 
products. They include the growing consumer unease with deregulated energy 
markets, the potential for disruptions to energy imports, and the maturation 
of fuel cell technology which 
provides a feasible system for storing excess power
generation for later use. 
<p>
Because of the innovative and technical nature of their products, 
SBE employs sales agents who can guide customers through the
process of choosing an alternative energy system. 
Other SBE employees are identified as a product "owners".  The product
owner is the expert on a particular product or product line. 
As the authoritative source of product information he produces
whitepapers--highly technical and focused documents on product 
specifications.
<p>
As alternative energy becomes more mainstream,
SBE anticipates changes in the needs of their customers.
Some customers will be more knowledgeable
and will need less assistance from a sales agent.  
Expanding sales outside the United States will drive the
need to service customers in languages other than English.
<p>
Currently there are two separate web sites.  The public website
(www.sbe.com) is static HTML.  It provides general information
about SBE and its products.   Customers who are interested in
ordering are provided contact information for the nearest
SBE sales office.  The internal website (www.sbesales.com) is restricted
to SBE employees and provides detailed product information.  Sales orders
are placed by agents on this site.  Two different Oracle databases underly 
these sites.
<p>
Problems with the current system include
<ul>
<li>the information available on the public website is too limited
    and the user cannot immediately place an order
<li>the existence of two databases means information is often
    inconsistent or incorrect
<li>users who need more technical information have difficulty accessing
    the relevant whitepapers
<li>sales agents have difficulty reaching product owners
</ul>
Imogene I. Ives,
President of SBE has requested that an analysis be done with a view to 
reengineering the current sales system.
The new system should allow customers direct access to product
information and ordering as well as continuing to provide support to 
the existing sales agent network.
<h2>1.4 Project Scope</h2>
The scope of this project is a web-based system that supports the  
marketing of SBE products directly
to customers as well as through the existing sales agent network.
Advertising of products, inventory control, 
and account billing are not part of this project.
<p>
The two current web sites will be replaced by this new system.  In addition,
changes to the logical and physical design of the current databases
are expected.  The actual implementation of a new database system is not
part of this project.  A web search engine and language translator will
be obtained as purchased components for the new system.  Their internal 
details are not part of this project.  Issues of website security, other 
than password protection within the site, are not part of this project.

<h2>1.5 System Purpose</h2>
<h3>1.5.1 Users</h3>
Those who will primarily benefit from the new system and those who
will be affected by the new system include
<dl>
<dt>Customers:
    <dd>Upon implementation of the new system, customers will
        find site navigation, product identification and product
        ordering easier.  Customers will be able to choose whether
        to buy directly from SBE or work with a sales agent.
         
<dt>Sales Agents:
    <dd>The new system will provide sales agents with more detailed,
        accurate and up-to-date product information.  They will be
        informed of potential customers more quickly and they will
        have faster access to the product owner.
<dt>Product Owners:
    <dd>Product owners will be allowed to maintain the data about
        their products directly.  This will eliminate delays in
        getting new products or changed product specifications into
        the system.
<dt>Customer Service Department:
    <dd>The new system should reduce the workload of Customer Service
        as customers are able to find the information they need from
        the web-site.
<dt>Marketing Department:
    <dd>Site navigation data could be sent to the Marketing
        Department.  Understanding how a customer uses the web site
        to make a purchase will result in improvements in getting
        and keeping customers.
<dt>Accounting Department:
    <dd>Purchase information will be sent directly to Accounting,
        allowing for more accurate and timely billing.
<dt>Shipping Department:
    <dd>Purchase information will be sent directly to Shipping
        for inventory control and order processing.
<dt>Information Technology Department:
    <dd> This department will be responsible for implementing the
         new database, hosting the website and maintaining the system.
</dl>
<h3>1.5.2 Location</h3>
The system will be available to any potential customer using the
Internet.  SBE employees may also use the system from any location
and will be able to access restricted areas of the site through a password
protection scheme. 
<h3>1.5.3 Responsibilities</h3>
The primary responsibilities of the new system:
<ul>
<li> provide customers direct access to up-to-date, accurate
     product information on which they can make a decision
     to buy
<li> customize product offerings to specific users
<li> allow differential access to web pages based on
     type of user
<li> allow customers to place an order through the website
<li> allow customers to request the assistance of a sales agent
<li> provide sales agents improved access to product information
     and product owners
<li> allow product owners to maintain information about their
     products directly
<li> allow access to whitepapers on demand
<li> send order information directly to Accounting and Shipping
</ul>
Other desired features of the new system:

<ul>
<li>a consistent "look and feel" throughout the website
<li>full-text searches of the web pages a user has permission
    to access
<li>on-line help in website navigation
<li>password protection scheme for non-public web pages
<li>translation of a web page to another language
</ul>
The system will not be responsible for account receivables,
or inventory control.
<h3>1.5.4 Need</h3>
This system is needed in order to service the expected increase in
demand for alternative energy products.  Replacement of the current
websites will eliminate the shortcomings of those sites.  The new
system will allow SBE to rapidly increase sales without a large
and expensive increase in the number of sales agents and other
customer support employees.
<h2>1.6 Overview of Document</h2>
The rest of this document gives the detailed specifications for the
new sales system.  It is organized as follows:
<ul>
<li>Section 2: Functional Objectives<br>
Each objective gives a desired behavior for the system, a business
justification, and a measure to determine if the final system has
successfully met the objective.  These objectives are organized by priority.
In order for the new system to be considered successful, all high
priority objectives must be met.
<li>Section 3: Non-Functional Objectives<br>
This section is organized by category.  Each objective specifies
a technical requirement or constraint on the overall characteristics
of the system.  Each objective is measurable.
<li>Section 4: Context Model<br>
This section gives a text description of the goal of the system, and a
pictorial description of the scope of the system in a context diagram.
Those entities outside the system that interact with the system are described.
<li>Section 5: Use Case Model<br>
The specific behavioral requirements of the system are detailed in
a series of use cases.  Each use case accomplishes a business task
and shows the interaction between the system and some outside actor.
Each use case is described with both text and an interaction diagram.
An interface prototype is also shown.
The system use case diagram depicts the interactions between all
use cases and system actors.
<li>Section 6: Class Model<br>
A class is a collection of objects in the system that have the
same data and behavior.
All analysis classes and their relationships are shown on the
class diagram.
<li>Section 7: An appendix containing a glossary that<br>
defines terms specific to this project

</ul>
<a name=Func><h1>2. Functional Objectives</h1></a>

<h2>2.1 High Priority</h2>
<ol>
<li>The system shall allow for on-line product ordering by either
the customer or the sales agent.  For customers, this will eliminate
the current delay between their decision to buy and the placement
of the order.  This will
reduce the time a sales agent spends on an order by x%.
The cost to process an order will be reduced to $y. 
<li>The system shall reflect a new and changed product description within
x minutes of the database being updated by the product owner.  This will 
reduce the number of incidents of incorrectly displayed information by x%.  
This
eliminates the current redundant update of information, saving $y dollars
annually.
 
<li>The system shall display information that is customized based
on the user's company, job function, application and locale.  This feature will
improve service by reducing the mean number of web pages a user
must navigate per session to x.  It should reduce unnecessary phone
calls to sales agents and staff by x%.

<li>The system shall allow employees to view the owner of any product.  
An employee should be able to contact the correct owner
in one phone call x% of the time.
<li>The system shall allow a customer to directly contact the nearest sales 
office in his region.  This will improve service by reducing the time
to respond to a customer request to no more than x days.
<li>The system shall provide accounting with accurate purchase transaction 
data.  This will improve customer service by reducing billing complaints
by x% and save $y in correcting inaccurate accounts.
<li>The system shall provide shipping with accurate order data.  This will
allow the order to be processed in x days and inventory to be updated 
within y hours.
</ol>
<h2>2.2 Medium Priority</h2>
<ol>
<li>The system shall provide a search facility that will allow full-text
searching of all web pages that the user is permitted to access.  The
system must support the following searches:
<ul>
<li>find all words specified
<li>find any word specified
<li>find the exact phrase
<li>Boolean search
</ul>
<li>The system shall make whitepapers available from the product page.  
This will allow customers to
answer product questions themselves, reducing customer support
costs by $x annually. 
</ol>
<h2>2.3 Low Priority</h2>
<ol>
<li>The system shall allow the user's status to be stored for the
next time he returns to the web site.  This will save the user x minutes
per visit by not having to reenter already supplied data.
<li>The system shall provide marketing with customer navigation
information.  This information will allow marketing to determine
what information prompts a purchase and help target potential
customers more effectively.  This will increase annual revenue
by $x in additional sales.
<li>The system shall translate web pages into the languages of
the countries where the company's products are available.  This
will improve customer service and reduce the number of support
calls from foreign customers by x%.
